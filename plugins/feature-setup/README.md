# Feature Setup

Systematically set up new features from planning through implementation structure.

## What It Does

Claude automatically uses this skill when starting new features. Creates structured setups with:

- **Requirements clarity** — Scope, user stories, acceptance criteria
- **Proper branching** — Feature branches with clear naming
- **Architecture planning** — Data models, APIs, components
- **Project structure** — Organized directories and files

## Usage

"Set up a new feature for user authentication"
"Start working on the payment integration"
"Create a feature branch and plan the approach"

Claude will guide you through requirements, create the branch, plan the architecture, and set up the initial structure.
