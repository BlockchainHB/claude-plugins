# Git Commit Helper

Create detailed, well-structured git commits with conventional commit format.

## What It Does

Claude automatically uses this skill when committing changes. Creates professional commits with:

- **Conventional format** — Type, scope, and clear summary
- **Detailed body** — What changed, why, and affected components
- **File documentation** — Every file touched with line counts
- **Safety checks** — Branch verification, no secrets, no force push

## Usage

"Commit these changes"
"Create a commit for the auth updates"
"Stage and commit the new feature"

Claude will review staged changes, write a detailed commit message, and guide you through the commit safely.
