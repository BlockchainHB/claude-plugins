# human-writing

Write authentic, human-sounding content by avoiding AI writing patterns. Based on [Wikipedia's Signs of AI Writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing).

## When to Use

Use this skill when writing:
- Landing pages and marketing copy
- Blog posts and articles
- Email campaigns
- Social media content
- Any content that needs to sound natural

## What It Does

This skill provides comprehensive guidelines for avoiding common AI writing tells:

- **Banned Words**: A complete list of words that signal AI authorship (delve, leverage, robust, seamless, etc.)
- **Banned Phrases**: Phrases to never use ("It's important to note", "In today's fast-paced world", etc.)
- **Content Patterns**: How to avoid superficial analysis, promotional language, and generic statements
- **Language Patterns**: Avoiding the rule of three, negative parallelisms, and elegant variation
- **Style Rules**: Proper use of boldface, em dashes, title case, and formatting
- **Examples**: Before/after examples for landing pages, emails, blogs, and product descriptions

## Key Principles

1. **Be specific, not generic** - "Grew team from 5 to 200" beats "visionary leader"
2. **Cut the fluff** - Remove words that add no meaning
3. **Vary your structure** - Don't always use lists of three
4. **Show, don't declare** - Don't tell readers something is important; show why
5. **Use simple words** - "Use" not "utilize", "help" not "facilitate"
