## Content Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Undue Emphasis on Symbolism/Legacy/Importance

AI constantly reminds readers how important things are. Cut these entirely.

```
BAD: "The founding of Idescat represented a significant shift toward
     regional statistical independence, enabling Catalonia to develop
     a statistical system tailored to its unique socio-economic context."

GOOD: "Idescat was founded in 1989 to produce regional statistics for Catalonia."
```

### 2. Superficial Analysis with "-ing" Endings

AI ends sentences with "-ing" phrases for fake depth.

```
BAD: "She won the award, cementing her legacy in the industry."
BAD: "The update includes new features, making it easier than ever."
BAD: "He founded the company, revolutionizing the market."

GOOD: "She won the award."
GOOD: "The update includes new features."
GOOD: "He founded the company."
```

### 3. Promotional/Advertisement Language

AI writes like marketing copy, not information.

```
BAD: "TTDC acts as the gateway to Tamil Nadu's diverse attractions,
     seamlessly connecting the beginning and end of every traveller's journey."

GOOD: "TTDC operates tourism services across Tamil Nadu."
```

### 4. "Challenges and Future Prospects" Sections

AI adds formulaic sections about challenges. Cut them.

```
BAD: "Despite its industrial and residential prosperity, Korattur faces
     challenges typical of urban areas... With its strategic location and
     ongoing initiatives, Korattur continues to thrive..."

GOOD: (Don't include vague challenge sections at all)
```

### 5. Generic Over Specific

AI replaces specific facts with vague positives.

```
BAD: "A visionary leader who transformed the industry."
GOOD: "She grew the team from 5 to 200 in 18 months."

BAD: "An innovative solution for modern businesses."
GOOD: "Cuts invoice processing from 2 hours to 10 minutes."

BAD: "Recognized for excellence in the field."
GOOD: "Won the 2024 Product Hunt #1 Product of the Day."
```

### 6. Vague Attribution of Opinion

AI attributes opinions to unnamed authorities.

```
BAD: "Industry reports suggest..."
BAD: "Observers have cited..."
BAD: "Experts argue..."
BAD: "Some critics argue..."

GOOD: (Either name the specific source or cut it)
```

## Language Patterns to Avoid

### The Rule of Three

AI groups things in threes obsessively. Vary your lists.

```
BAD: "Our platform is fast, reliable, and secure."
BAD: "We offer speed, simplicity, and scalability."
BAD: "Join marketers, developers, and designers."

GOOD: "Our platform is fast and reliable."
GOOD: "We built this for speed."
GOOD: "Built for developers."
```

### Negative Parallelisms

AI uses "not only... but also" and "not just... it's..." constantly.

```
BAD: "Not only a work of self-representation, but a visual document
     of her obsessions."
BAD: "It's not just about the beat; it's part of the aggression."

GOOD: (Rewrite as a simple direct statement)
```

### Elegant Variation

AI avoids repeating words by using synonyms excessively.

```
BAD: "Soviet artistic constraints... non-conformist artists... their
     creativity... this struggle... the constraints..."

GOOD: Just repeat the word if that's what you mean.
```

### False Ranges

AI uses "from X to Y" with unrelated endpoints.

```
BAD: "From the singularity of the Big Bang to the grand cosmic web,
     from the birth and death of stars to the dance of dark matter..."

GOOD: (List items normally without fake ranges)
```

---

## Style Rules

### Never Use Title Case in Headings

```
BAD: ## Strategic Negotiations And Global Partnerships
GOOD: ## Strategic negotiations and global partnerships
```

### Avoid Excessive Boldface

AI bolds every key term. Use bold sparingly.

```
BAD: "A **leveraged buyout (LBO)** is characterized by the extensive use
     of **debt financing** to acquire a company. This financing structure
     enables **private equity firms**..."

GOOD: "A leveraged buyout (LBO) uses debt financing to acquire a company..."
```

### Limit Em Dashes

AI overuses em dashes (—). Use one per paragraph maximum. Prefer commas and periods.

```
BAD: "Our tool—designed for teams—helps you ship faster—without complexity."
GOOD: "Our tool helps teams ship faster. No complexity."
```

### Never Use Emojis in Professional Content

AI loves decorating with emojis. Don't.

---

## Format Rules

### Headlines

```
BAD: "Unlock the Power of Seamless Integration"
GOOD: "Connect your tools in 5 minutes"

BAD: "Revolutionizing the Way Teams Collaborate"
GOOD: "Your team, one inbox"

BAD: "The Future of Customer Engagement"
GOOD: "Reply to customers 3x faster"
```

### Opening Lines

Never start with:
- "In today's..."
- "In an era of..."
- "Are you tired of..."
- "Imagine a world where..."
- "What if you could..."

Start with:
- A specific fact
- A direct statement
- The user's problem
- What your product does

```
BAD: "In today's competitive landscape, businesses need..."
GOOD: "Your competitors respond to leads in 5 minutes. You take 5 hours."

BAD: "Imagine a world where your data is always secure..."
GOOD: "Your data is encrypted. Always."
```

### Calls to Action

```
BAD: "Embark on your journey today"
BAD: "Unlock your potential now"
BAD: "Transform your workflow"

GOOD: "Start free"
GOOD: "Try it now"
GOOD: "Get started"
```
