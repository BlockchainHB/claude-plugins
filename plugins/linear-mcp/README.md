# Linear MCP Tools

Work with Linear project management via MCP tools.

## What It Does

Claude automatically uses this skill when working with Linear. Provides comprehensive reference for:

- **Issue management** — Create, update, query issues
- **Project operations** — Projects, milestones, initiatives
- **Team collaboration** — Comments, assignments, labels
- **GraphQL patterns** — Correct mutation syntax and schemas

## Usage

"Create a Linear issue for the auth bug"
"Update the project status in Linear"
"Add a comment to DVP-40"
"List all issues in the current sprint"

Claude will use the correct MCP tools with proper GraphQL syntax to interact with Linear.

## Requirements

Requires Linear MCP server configured (e.g., via Rube MCP or similar).
