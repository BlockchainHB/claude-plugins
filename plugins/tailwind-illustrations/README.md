# Tailwind UI Illustrations
Creates polished, interactive landing page illustrations that showcase real app functionality—not placeholder rectangles.

## What It Does
Claude automatically uses this skill when building landing page components. Creates production-ready illustrations with:

- **Real UI elements** — Actual text labels, data structures, and interactive states
- **Dashboard previews** — Sidebar + content layouts with clickable navigation
- **Hero sections** — Tab-based screenshot switchers with smooth animations
- **Production styling** — Proper shadows, borders, and decorative patterns

## Usage
"Create a landing page illustration showing the dashboard"
"Build an interactive sidebar + content preview"
"Make a hero section with tab-based screenshots"
"Design a demo component that shows the app in action"

Claude will create self-contained React components with Tailwind CSS, complete with realistic sample data and interactive states.
